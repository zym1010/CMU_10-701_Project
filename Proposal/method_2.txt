First, we plan to try some methods that make classification based on $C$ binary classifiers, where $C$ is the number of classes (DeviceId in this context). In terms of the binary classifier, we will initially try logistic regression. We choose it because its output can be interpreted as the confidence over classificaton, which is consistent with the evalution criteria. If this doesn't work well, it may be due to that the data points are highly non-linear, and we may try some kernel versions of logistic regression. In addition, probablistic versions of SVM are worth trying.

Second, we will try some generative methods, like naive Bayes classifier and Gaussian mixture model, to model the joint distribution of label (DeviceID) and features (timestamps and acceleration measures). Again, kernel tricks may be applied to these methods.
