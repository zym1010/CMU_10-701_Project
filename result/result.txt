6 features are used.

1. FFT features (mentioned already in report)
2. Reading overlap features (mentioned already in report)
3. Sampling interval histogram features (mentioned already in report)

4. Histogram of all resampled readings for each segment (per segment, not per device).
5. Histogram of absolute difference between adjacent readings for each segment (per segment, not per device).
6. Histogram of length of acceleration (\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}) for each segment (per segment, not per device).

The code for last three new features can be seen at /feature_generation/generate_additional_main_feature.m.
